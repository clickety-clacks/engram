No substantive findings.

Both documents are consistent with the spec. The authority chain (spec → ADAPTERS.md → CLAUDE_REVIEWERS.md) is explicit and correctly ordered. Coverage event kinds match the spec's tape event schema. The `meta` field enumeration (model, repo state, label) matches the spec's event schema section. The non-prescriptive/raw-fact principle (P6) is reflected in MUST #2 and #6. Chronological ordering matches the spec's append-only tape definition. The adapter metadata "(or equivalent side metadata)" qualifier correctly avoids mandating a non-spec event kind in the tape stream. CI gates and versioning governance are additive adapter-specific concerns that don't conflict with spec requirements.
